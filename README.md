# Chrome extension that allows you to search through comments on any youtube video.

Extension isnt secure enough. I should put big part of the quota logic to the server side if I want publish it on Google store. I thought about this in early/mid development but didnt want to mess with all "server-side" stuff. At the end I added server part anyway just to show my ASP.NET Core skill. So now migration will be much easier because most of the work with the server already done. I just need to rewrite js as c#. But I will do it a little bit later.
Also I dont know Js much, so its possible that usage of language features is pretty awful here. And first git commit messages too
